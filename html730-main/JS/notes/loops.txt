Loops: loops will repeat again and again. each repitition is called iteration
We have primarily two sets of loops exist.
  i. entry control loops : eg:while,for etc..,
  ii. exit control loops : eg: do while 
i. Entry control loops: these loops checks the condition at the starting/entry.
A loop contains three phases (initialization, condition, updation)
eg: while , for loops
ii. Exit control loops: These loops checks the condition at the exit
Eg: Dowhile

while: while is a entry control loops which is used to iterate certain statements according to a condition
  initialization;

  while(condition){
    //code
    updation;
  }

dowhile: dowhile is an exit control loop which is used to iterate certain statements according to a condition
whether condition is true or false, it executes one time atleast

initialization;

do{
  //code
  updation
}while(condition);


standard for: standard for is an entry control loops whicj is used to iterate certain statements based on a condition but here, initialization,condition and 
updation will be in same line
for(initialization;condition;updation){
  //code
}
